# Ann Arbor Housing Survey
*W2020 MDST Project: a survey of housing in Ann Arbor, Michigan*

## Introduction
Any student at the University of Michigan knows how much it sucks to find affordable housing on- or off-campus. 
While dorms are a convenient option, they are not necessarily affordable: the cheapest undergrad housing option, a triple, comes out to about [$9,910](https://housing.umich.edu/undergraduate-rates/), or about $1,200 per month. 
Don't even get me started on some of the higher-end apartments! ðŸ¤¯

Affordable housing is often either located in inconvenient locations or lack basic amenities, while locations close to campus tend to have exorbitant prices... the problems are clear.
If you're a student, grad or undergrad, you probably have a vested interest in something like this. While I can't offer such a perspective, I'd bet good money the Ann Arbor townies are likely to agree as well!

## Description
The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of the state of (student) housing in A2 today. Questions that we hope to answer include, but are not limited to:
* Where is the "optimal" place to live, taking into account metrics such as price, room size, and location?
* What are the most desirable areas, and how can we predict a posting's "desirability"?
* What trends can we observe when we sort by area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and more? 
* What features are most predictive of the price? Any surprising insights?  
* ...and many more to be thought of!

Join this project if you have any interest in the following:
* web systems and scraping
* data visualization
* natural language processing
* working with biased data 
* *machine learning as used in regression(?)*
* (finding housing for next year, lol)

## Goals 
1. Acquaint members with the basic structure and timeline of a data science project
2. Provide members with practical, hands-on experience in tools commonly used in industry and research: web scraping, various ML algorithms, version control, etc.
3. Identify key trends in housing and generate applicable insights that could help a potential confused student decide where to sign next year
4. Publish results and final visualization in the Michigan Daily
5. Have fun and learn something! :)

## Stretch Goals
1. Gather historic data and visualize how prices/etc. have changed over time
2. Compare results to that of other "Ann Arbor-like" college towns (Madison, Urbana/Champaign, Durham?)
    - This needs to be formalized: develop a metric for similarity
3. Price prediction?
    - Given a location, predict how much housing is likely to cost (this is a simple regression task; probably too easy!)
